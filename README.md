I'm a senior front–end engineer and design–focused UI/UX specialist with 15+ years of experience crafting accessible, engaging web experiences. I began web development at age 13, driven by curiosity, and have since built expertise in graphic design and diverse web and app development. At Docker, I work on AI agents and developer tooling, blending React, TypeScript, and design systems with a strong eye for typography and inclusive design. I lead teams through migrations, AI–powered workflows, and analytics surfaces that feel as good as they perform, combining technical expertise with strong design sensibility and deep UI/UX and typography knowledge.
