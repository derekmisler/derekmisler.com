I am a software engineer living in New York with 10+ years experience. I have a diverse education, both traditional and self-driven, of many different web and app development languages for desktop and mobile. I am fluent with HTML5, CSS3 (including CSS preprocessors like LESS and Sass) along with JavaScript (ES6/7), including frameworks like React/Redux, React Native, Angular, Aurelia, Next.js. I have experience with back-end languages, too, like Node, Ruby, Java, and a long history with PHP. I also have a design background, tons of UI/UX experience, and a surprisingly large knowledge of typography (seriously, let's talk about it). I think all developers should study design, and I believe having this well-rounded education makes me a stronger engineer.
