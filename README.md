I am a software engineer living in Brooklyn, NY with a design background and 15+ years of experience building exceptional, high-quality websites and applications. I have a diverse education, both traditional and self-driven, of many different web and app development languages for desktop and mobile. I also have a design background, tons of UI/UX experience, and a surprisingly large knowledge of typography (seriously, let's talk about it). I think all developers should study design, and I believe having this well-rounded education makes me a stronger engineer.
