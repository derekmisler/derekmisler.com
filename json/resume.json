			"biography": "I am a front-end developer and UI/UX designer living in New York with 10+ years experience. I have a diverse education, both traditional and self-driven, of many different web and app development languages for desktop and mobile. I am basically fluent with HTML5, CSS3 (including CSS preprocessors like LESS and Sass) along with JavaScript/jQuery (including frameworks like Angular and React). I have a lot of experience with Javascript templating languages like Liquid/Jekyll and Goatee. I have experience with back-end and software languages, too, like C# and .NET, Node, Python, Ruby, and a long history with PHP. I also have a design background a surprisingly large knowledge of typography (seriously, let's talk about it). I think all developers should study design, and I believe having this well-rounded education makes me a stronger developer.",

We started with a .NET-backed site, and one of my first tasks was to create a matching mobile site and responsive blog theme. While I was on board, I oversaw two redesigns, first with Coldfusion and more recently with a responsive site that was built with Node on the back-end and a custom JS templating language, Goatee, on the front-end. I've been in charge of creating all print- and web-related assets for our various marketing campaigns, all of the data analysis of those campaigns, and two long-form, media-rich, highly interactive, award-winning web applications. I also oversaw the email marketing program, which included designing and creating the email templates, capturing and segmenting demographic data, and the analysis of the data we received after each campaign.",
